# Data and Privacy policies

- Ben-bot DOES NOT collect or store ANY user data from the user
- All the data sent into the bot are those with user consent*

- By that, we are in total compliance with all relevant data protection laws such as **GDPR**, **CCPA**, **CalOPPA**, and **PIPEDA**

- As said this program does not and will not store any data from the users, and the **message.content** that is used in the randomizing algorithm is not monitored, stored, or shown in the console at all, it is only *temporarily* saved on the memory and it is *discarded and cleared* once the bot is done sending the reply

- Our only usage of "message.content" is its length and it's for determining is it 6 characters long or not, and that's all 

- Users are welcome to email/dm me and ask for a deletion of their data, and we will probably get rid of nothing because we don't have any data to begin with

- But we understand the concern and take full responsibility for your provided data and we are fully transparent as you can see in our code repository
- You can fully opt out of providing data by not using the command "yo ben" and the program will ignore your message completely
